PreMEST Day 2 Assignment

Part 1:
* Build the front of a weather app:
* A home page
* A login page 
* Include a search bar in your app

    - You DO NOT have to implement any functionality. Focus on building the static component and think about how you would divide the two pages and implement it
    - Think about and use the principles we have learnt in class (Components, State, Props, Jsx)
    - You can hard code the details of your weather ( we will cover using an Api soon and part 2 of this assignment will test that)
Part 2

* Commit your code regularly to git as you build your app (Create a new repo for this assignment 
* Research GIT BRANCHES and see how you can incorporate that in your git practice
* Submit your assignment using this google form: https://forms.gle/xwBqdfsDUBwyYocC6
